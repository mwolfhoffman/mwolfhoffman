# Michael Wolf Hoffman 

<p>
I am a software engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I go by my middle name.

I'm passionate about modern JavaScript frameworks, micro-servicing front ends, large rocky mountains, and my two dogs :dog:  :dog: .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  💻 I’m currently working at Colt Builders in Murray, Utah.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  :white_check_mark: My expertise is web and I do all things JavaScript and TypeScript (Node, Express, React, Vue, Angular)
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  📝 I'm a big fan of writing and teaching. I do both on [My Blog](https://codewithwolf.com/).
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  🔎 I’m always learning and lately have been delving deep into the depths of Python.
